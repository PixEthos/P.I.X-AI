# PixAI

If you want to see the progress, look here:
[Development branch](https://github.com/PixEthos/PixAI/tree/master)

When the AI is finished, it will be able to:
- Generate words/sentences
- Have basic conversations
- Have recurrent memory

This isn't an AI for those looking for complete data processing, this is just a FOSS AI I am developing for the sake of it. All from scratch too, with the standard library in Go. No need for me to add int additional data; when none is really required.
