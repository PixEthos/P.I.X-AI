# PixAI
This is essentially something I am working on. From Basic_AI (something I gave up on) to a new AI, something I am working on, and it's in Go.

What will it feature? 
- NLP, mostly because why not?

It's just to see if I can do this. Lightweight, but capable I suppose. Should be able to release it witin a few months entirely. So long as I can get everything done that I need to.
